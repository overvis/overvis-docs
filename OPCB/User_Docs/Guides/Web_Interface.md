# Web Interface

To access the product via the Web interface, connect the device (computer or telephone) to the
local network that the OPCB 221 is configured to work with. Then enter the address of the product
in the browser:

- fixed address assigned during configuration in the local network;
- or a temporary dynamic address, which can be obtained through the Web-interface of the LAN router
  (if there is access to it);
- or `setup.overvis.com` (`192.168.4.1`) address, if the product creates its own Wi-Fi access point
  during the initial setup.

The setup page will open, as shown in the figure.

By selecting the required tabs and subsections in them, the OPCB-221 should be configured

_If the device is to work via a cloud server, you must configure one or more network interfaces in
the `Network` tabs, through which the OPCB-221 can access the Internet. Then on the `Overvis` tab,
if necessary, configure the address of the cloud server. After correctly configuring the Internet
access settings, saving the settings and restarting the device, the connection to the cloud server
will be established. Further configuration can be done through the cloud server._

When the settings are complete, use the `Save settings` button to save the parameters.

Then click `Restart` button in the `Actions` menu to restart the OPCB-221 and apply the settings.
