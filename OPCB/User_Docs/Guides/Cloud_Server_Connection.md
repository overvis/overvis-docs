# Cloud Server Connection

To access the OPCB via the cloud server, follow the link on the product label (or the QR code on
the label). If an Overvis account has not been logged in, the login page will open. If there is no
account, it is necessary to register a new one on this page. An example of the page is shown in the
image.

After logging in, the page will open for adding a new network (with OPCB as the access gateway for
this network). The form on the page will have the fields filled in for communication with the
product. If the product was already configured and has the Internet access, it would be confirmed
on this page. An example of the page is shown in the image.

Enter the name of the network with the device in the "Name" field. If necessary, you can add the
Modbus devices connected to OPCB to the "Connected devices" list, or you can do it later. Then
press the "Install" button to add the network with the product to the account.
