In conjunction with Overvis cloud monitoring, OPCB-221B devices provide:

**Data collection:**

- Gather operational data points (any numeric values) from your equipment.
- Store history of operational data, and get insights and analytics.
- Collected data is fully exportable (Excel, CSV).
- Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) reporting.

**SMS and email notifications:**

- Configure alarms for operational parameter thresholds or connection errors.
- Set up a “chain of responsibility” requiring alarm confirmations from personnel and escalating
  them in the absence of response.
- All alarm actions are logged and ready for review.

**Real-time monitoring and control:**

- Create dashboards with real-time information received from the equipment.
- Visualize the data using open SVG format.
- Use Google Maps API to display objects’ locations.
- Use JavaScript and Overvis API to set up quick action controls for operation personnel.

**And more:**

- Use templates to quickly create devices and alarms.
- Manage access levels for different accounts inside one organization.
- Works with dynamic IPs and bypasses firewalls.
- Optimized mobile access.
- Industry-standard encryption.
- Overvis API allows the automation of control and can be used to load data into other management
  systems.
